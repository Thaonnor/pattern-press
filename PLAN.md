# KubeJS Integration Implementation Plan

## Current Status: Core System Complete âœ…
- **Import System**: Comprehensive CLI tool with 70+ mod support
- **Configuration**: Intelligent filtering with 250+ recipe types categorized
- **Web Server**: Express API with filtering and statistics endpoints
- **Testing**: Full test suite with coverage reporting
- **Ready for Frontend Enhancement**

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Core Import System âœ…
**Goal**: Import KubeJS JSON files and organize by mod

**Completed**:
- âœ… Built robust import CLI tool (`src/import-recipes.js`)
- âœ… Implemented recursive JSON file discovery
- âœ… Added intelligent recipe type categorization
- âœ… Built comprehensive mod support (70+ mods)
- âœ… Enhanced with detailed statistics and logging
- âœ… Added recipe type normalization and error handling

### Phase 2: Basic Web Server âœ…
**Goal**: Serve imported recipes via web API

**Completed**:
- âœ… Built Express server (`src/server.js`)
- âœ… Implemented `/recipes` endpoint with filtering
- âœ… Added `/stats` endpoint for comprehensive analytics
- âœ… Built foundation HTML frontend
- âœ… Added CORS support and error handling

### Phase 3: Configuration & Analysis âœ…
**Goal**: Comprehensive recipe type management

**Completed**:
- âœ… Systematic analysis of 250+ recipe types across major mods
- âœ… Built intelligent whitelist/ignore categorization
- âœ… Enhanced import reporting (separated vs ignored statistics)
- âœ… Fixed edge cases and normalization issues
- âœ… Achieved zero unsupported recipes in typical configurations

## Next Phase

### Phase 4: Frontend Enhancement ðŸš§
**Goal**: Build comprehensive web interface for recipe browsing

**Planned Tasks**:
- Enhanced UI/UX for recipe browsing and filtering
- Advanced search and pagination
- Recipe detail views with JSON inspection
- Statistics dashboard and analytics
- Responsive design and accessibility

## Implementation Philosophy

### "Import Everything, See What Happens"
- No complex validation upfront
- Store raw KubeJS JSON and organize later
- Build features as actually needed
- Personal tool - no enterprise requirements

### JSON-First Storage
- One JSON file per mod for easy viewing
- Git-friendly diffs and version control
- No database complexity
- Direct file editing when needed

### Incremental Development
- Start small (minecraft only)
- Prove each phase works before expanding
- Add complexity only when required
- Keep codebase readable and maintainable

## Next Steps
1. Build Phase 1 import system
2. Test with minecraft recipes
3. Expand to more mods as needed
